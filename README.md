# Ex1

# Number Conversion Project

This program performs number conversion from different representations, performs addition and multiplication,
and converts the results to different bases (from 2 to 16).

## Description

The user enters two numbers in different representations, and the program:
1. Converts the numbers to their decimal integer values.
2. Performs addition and multiplication.
3. Converts the results back to the selected base (between 2 and 16).
4. Displays the largest number among the input numbers, addition result, and multiplication result.



#### Example:

##Ex1 class solution:
## Enter a string as number#1 (or "quit" to end the program): 
101b2
num1 = 101b2 is number :true value: 5
## Enter a string as number#2 (or "quit" to end the program): 
A b16
num2 = Ab16 is number :true value :10
## Enter a base for output : ( a number [2 - 16])
8
101b2+ Ab16 = 15b8
101b2* Ab16 = 50b8
Max number over 101b2,Ab16,101b2+A b16=15b8,101b2* Ab16=50b8 is: 50b8
